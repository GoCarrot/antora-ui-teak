:page-no-nav: true

= Welcome to Teak

I added the ability to disable the navigation by putting ``:page-no-nav: true`` at the top.

What we're gonna probably want here is a kind of "choose your adventure". Ultimately we're sending people to one of the following components:

* Getting Started (this module)
* xref:usage::page$index.adoc[Teak Usage]
* xref:unity::page$before-you-start.adoc[Unity]
* xref:ios::page$integration.adoc[iOS]
* xref:android::page$integration.adoc[Android]
* xref:server-api::page$rewards/endpoint.adoc[Server API]

== TODO List

* Make footer less obtrusive?
* Finish this page
* Landing page for Teak Usage, not sure just the TOC is a good idea (or needed)
